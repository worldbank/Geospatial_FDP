# Baseline data assessment and report for Chad camps

## Quantitative assessment of OpenStreetMap (OSM) completeness

The OSM completeness of buildings and highways data is different in each of the refuges.

In terms of the OSM data coverage; of the 22 refuges evaluated; only 3 refuges had already high coverage of buildings and highways, 15 refuges have partial or low coverage of buildings or highways, and 4 refuges did not have data of buildings or highways.

Although there are refuges that already have data, the baseline data assessment, showed us that approximately 70% of the data has low quality, due to there is a mismatch between the data and the different satellite imagery or cases where the buildings were mapped with old imagery and need to be aligned to the most current imagery.

**Figure 1 - Buildings and highways that need to be aligned to the Maxar Premiun imagery (most current imagery in this location)**

Some other issues that need to be fixed are; misaligned highways, inaccurate buildings and highways, etc.

In table 3, we are doing a summary of the OSM data completeness; the data coverage and the data quality per refuge, this assessment was done separately for buildings and highways, and we have taken the following approach:

| **Levels**  | **Description**                                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High**    | Approximately more than 70% of buildings/highways were mapped     |
| **Partial** | Approximately between 30% - 70% of buildings/highways were mapped |
| **Low**     | Approximately less that 30% of buildings/highways were mapped     |
| **Nothing** | None building/highway mapped                                      |

**Table 1: OSM data coverage levels**

| **Levels** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Good**   | Buildings/highways mapped match with the current imagery and have the correct shape.                                                                                                            |
| **Medium** | Some areas of the refuge have buildings/highways with good quality and other areas have buildings/highways with low quality.                                                                    |
| **Low**    | Buildings/highways mapped do not match with the current imagery, have wrong shape, several buildings were mapped as only one building, and the data has different issues that need to be fixed. |

**Table 2: OSM data quality levels**

Also, we are adding the stats of buildings and highways found before start the mapping.

**Table 3: Summary per refuge of the OSM data completeness**

According to table 3, there are 3 refuges without buildings, 8 refuges with less than 500 buildings and 11 refuges with more than a thousand buildings. And about highways, there is 1 refuge without highways mapped, 14 refuges with less than 30 km of highways, and 7 refuges with more than 36 km of highways.

## Quality and currency of available imagery in base maps

There are different available satellite imagery that can be loaded in the JOSM editor for the mapping process; Bing aerial imagery, Esri World Imagery, ESRI Clarity, Maxar Premium, Mapbox Satellite.

However, from the baseline data assessment, we found that the imageries most used in the previous mappings were Maxar Premium and Bing aerial imagery.

About the currency, the dates of the images are unknown, so to know which of them is the most current, we did a comparison between them and one of the signs that one imagery is the most recent is that it shows buildings and/or highways in areas where the other imagery only shows an empty field.

**Figure 5 - Maxar premium (current imagery)**

Evaluating the quality of the imageries, we saw that Bing and Maxar have low quality in most of the refuges, consequently, the buildings cannot be easily recognized.

There are cases in which the data was added using Bing imagery, but since the most current imagery in almost all refuges is Maxar, we are going to align the existing data to Maxar.

In table 5, we are doing a summary of the most current imagery and its quality per refuge.

| **Levels** | **Description**                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High**   | When zoom in the imagery does not loses its resolution                                                                 |
| **Medium** | When zoom in the imagery loses its resolution but at least we can differentiate the buildings and highways for mapping |
| **Low**    | When zoom in the imagery loses its resolution but is difficult to differentiate the buildings for mapping              |

**Table 5: Summary per refuge of the most current imagery and its quality**

According to table 5, most refuges have poor quality imagery, so in total there are 17 refuges with poor quality imagery and 5 refuges with medium quality imagery. And the most current imagery is Maxar Premium.
