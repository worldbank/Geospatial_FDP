# Stage 5: Data collection/generation
Following stages 1-4, you should have a good understanding of the quality of the data, its coverage, and its gaps. Depending on the results of the evaluation, you may need to collect, acquire, or improve the data. To do so, please consult Annex 2:
- We classified each data item in Annex 2 by the potential for it to be mapped from satellite data
  - Items that can clearly be seen in images, such as roads or water bodies, are marked as “yes”. 
  - Items that can be mapped using satellite images but require additional on-the-ground attributes to be useful are marked as “partial”. 
  - We also marked for each layer/data item, if that data can be found on OpenStreetMap, or mapped into OpenStreetMap. 
  - Data items that may be found in OSM, but the level of detail and attributes required will most likely not be found on OSM are marked as “partial”.

Following these guidelines, there are numerous resources, options, and solutions, depending on whether the data can be derived from satellite imagery:
- Yes: but the data of interest have incomplete coverage, are out of date, or are inaccurate. Check out potential sources of satellite imagery and analysis, both commercial and not-for-profit:
  - UNOSAT – provide the United Nations funds, programs, and agencies with analysis, data products, and training on the use of satellite imagery. They have a deep repository of map products, and frequently contribute to open repositories of geospatial data.
  - Disaster Charter – a worldwide collaboration through which satellite data are made available for the benefit of disaster management. Commercial companies are tasked with collecting satellite imagery on the behalf of client countries, charter members, and disaster relief organizations.
  - HOT OSM – an international team dedicated to humanitarian action and community development through open mapping. HOT OSM offer their tasking manager to design and implement mapathons to complete maps in OpenStreetMap and provide consulting services both to map and verify data on the ground in OSM.
- No: the data of interest cannot be discerned from satellite imagery, so on-the-ground solutions must be sought. There are numerous commercial and non-for-profit solutions to consider:
  - GEMS – An initiative of the World Bank to empower local project implementors to collect data in smart, efficient, and consistent ways. By leveraging simple, open-source tools, the GEMS team has greatly improved the data collected by World Bank projects, and the solutions are easily replicable in other situations.

When collecting geospatial data for use in situations of forced displacement, it is important to consider not just the current use, but potential future uses of the data. As such, make sure to consider issues of interoperability, data schema, format, and licensing. Additionally, you should consider how and where the data will be stored and disseminated, start discussions with hosting solutions such as HDX and DDH before data collection begins, if possible.

## Stage 5b: Analysis, map production and dissemination
The hard work is done, now for the fun part – map production and analysis. While this document will not attempt to provide advice on all aspects of geospatial analysis and production, there are some consistent guidelines and suggestions that should apply to all projects.
1. Document from the start of the project
2. Consider data schemas throughout the project
3. Publish data and method alongside results
